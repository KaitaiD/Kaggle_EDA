Here I did a number of data visualization examples on different datasets I found online. Each of them showcases
various visualization techniques and plots. Datasets can be found in the links provided below if readers are
interested in attempting on any of them.

__1. Santander Customer Transaction Prediction - Kaggle Competition___

In this challenge, Santander invites Kagglers to help them identify which customers will make a specific
transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted. The data provided for this competition
has the same structure as the real data they have available to solve this problem.
